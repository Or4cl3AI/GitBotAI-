# GitBotAI

GitBotAI is a conversational GitHub app designed to assist with code and file generation, packaging and deployment, repository management, version control, and user authentication. It also provides robust natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities and comprehensive user support.

## Features

### Code and File Generation
- Identifies missing code or files within a given GitHub repository based on user input or specific requirements.
- Utilizes machine learning or predefined templates to generate the missing code or files.
- Ensures that the generated code or files are compatible with the existing codebase.

### Packaging and Deployment
- Provides functionality to package the codebase and its dependencies into a deployable format (e.g., Docker container, ZIP file).
- Allows the user to configure deployment settings, such as target environments, deployment scripts, and required resources.
- Supports seamless integration with popular deployment platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.

### Repository Management
- Enables users to easily manage their GitHub repositories using conversational commands.
- Allows users to create new repositories, initialize repositories with starter code, and manage repository settings.
- Provides features to track and monitor repository changes, such as commits, branches, and pull requests.

### Version Control Integration
- Integrates with Git to enable version control functionality within the chatbot.
- Allows users to create branches, commit changes, merge branches, and handle conflicts through conversational commands.
- Provides real-time notifications and updates on repository changes to keep users informed.

### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Develops a robust NLU system to understand user commands and intents.
- Supports a wide range of natural language queries related to code generation, repository management, and deployment.
- Utilizes NLU models, such as intent recognition, entity extraction, and dialogue management, to improve conversation flow and accuracy.

### User Authentication and Authorization
- Implements a secure authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access the app.
- Integrates with GitHub's authentication mechanism or OAuth to authenticate users and retrieve necessary permissions.
- Handles user access levels and permissions to prevent unauthorized actions on repositories.

### Documentation and User Support
- Provides comprehensive documentation that explains the features, functionalities, and usage of the app.
- Includes tutorials, code examples, and troubleshooting guides to assist users.
- Offers support channels, such as email, chat, or a dedicated support forum, to address user queries and issues.
